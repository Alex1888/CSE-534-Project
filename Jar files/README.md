P-Sim is a simple message-based simulator written in Java as part of the research on LOUP. Currently it supports the protocols listed on the side, but it can be used to simulate any distributed message-passing system. There are a couple of things which P-Sim can do:
* large-scale distributed protocol simulations - e.g. if you are interested in the behavior of iBGP in a several-thousand router AS
* observe pathologies which emerge from the behavior of distributed protocols - e.g. routing protocol loops
